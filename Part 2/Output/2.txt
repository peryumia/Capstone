1. problem description: "FJSP consists of a set of n independent jobs J = {j_i}_{i=1}^n, each having its own processing order through a set of m machines M = {m_k}_{k=1}^m. A number of ℓ_i ordered operations (O_i1,...,O_i(j)) has to be performed to complete job i. Operation j of job i (O_ij) can be processed by any machine in a given set M_j ⊆ M for a given processing time t_ijk. The FJSP can be considered as consisting of many unique JSPs because of the routing flexibility. While JSP consists of only a sequencing problem because the assignment of operations to the machines is given in advance, the FJSP turns into a routing as well as a sequencing problem: assigning each operation O_ij to a machine selected from the set M_j and ordering operations on the machines so that C_max is minimized. The following assumptions are made: the processing times are known and fixed. The setup times are either negligible or included in the processing times. Transportation times are ignored. All jobs are available at time zero. No pre-emption is allowed, and a machine can process only one operation at a time. There is only one feasible process plan for each job.";

1. problem description: "The FJSP-PPF considers multiple process plans for jobs by excluding the final assumption of FJSP. The problem consists of a set of n jobs, each having a set of τ(i) process plans P_i = {ρ_ip(i)}_p(i)=1^τ(i). The process plan p(i) of job i is an ordered list of ℓ_ip(i) operations. It is assumed that the process plans are known in advance and represented by linear precedence relationships. Operation j in the process plan p(i) of job i (O_ip(i)j) can be processed by any machine in a given set M_j ⊆ M for a given processing time t_ip(i)jk. Because only one of the alternative plans is to be adopted for each job, the FJSP-PPF deals with not only routing and sequencing sub-problems but also the process plan selection sub-problem: choosing a process plan for each job i from a given set of P(i), assigning each operation O_ip(i)j to a machine selected from the set M_j and ordering operations on the machines so that C_max is minimized.";
