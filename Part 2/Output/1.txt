0. article title: "Evolutionary algorithms for multi-objective flexible job shop cell scheduling"

1. problem description: "A flexible job shop environment in cellular manufacturing where c is the set of cells, l is the set of part families, i is the set of jobs, and q is the set of machines. Each job i includes op_i operations and each operation has its route to follow through the shop. For each operation j of job i, there are identical parallel machines. A cellular manufacturing system includes several manufacturing cells consisting of the different number of machines and allocated for the production of various parts. Each type of machine can process different parts and there are some particular parts referred to as exceptional parts that can move between cells. This study deals with the job shop cell scheduling problem with flexible machines and sequence-dependent family setup times which indicate that the family setup times are determined by the current part family as well as the direct previous part family processed on the same machine. Makespan and the total tardiness time are the objectives of the problem, which are to be minimized simultaneously.";
