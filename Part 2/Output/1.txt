1. problem description: "A flexible job shop cell scheduling problem in cellular manufacturing with sequence-dependent family setup times and intercellular transfer times. The environment consists of multiple cells, part families, jobs, and machines. Each job includes multiple operations with specific routes through the shop. Operations can be processed on identical parallel machines. Jobs may visit machines or work centers multiple times (reentrant parts). Processing times include intracellular move times, while intercellular transfer times are considered for exceptional parts moving between cells. Setup times depend on both current and previous part families processed on the same machine. The objectives are to minimize makespan and total tardiness simultaneously.";
